              <p>
                Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat
                oven to 350°F (177°C).
              </p>

                <strong>Make the crust:</strong> Using a food processor, pulse
                the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and
                stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also
                pulse it all together in the food processor.) Mixture will be
                sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of
                a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan
                first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust
                down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and
                place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil
                will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow
                crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.
              </p>

                <strong>Make the filling:</strong> Using a handheld or stand
                mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and
                granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl
                until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the
                sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until
                fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time,
                beating after each addition until just blended. After the final
                egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help
                prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools,
                avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.

                <strong>Prepare the simple water bath (see note)</strong> Boil a
                pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for
                the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire
                kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the
                aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake
                batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to
                smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan inside of a large
                roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and
                place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the
                oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for
                you.)

                Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost
                set. When it's done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly
                wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open
                the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in
                the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven
                and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room
                temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4
                hours or overnight. you.)

                Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the
                springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife,
                cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife
                clean and dip into warm water between each slice.

                cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
